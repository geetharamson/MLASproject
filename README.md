 #### Project Instructions
In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction available on Moodle. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you should explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.
2. Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.
3. Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.

## How to run the jupyter notebook
___________________________
+ On the command line navigate to the folder location where the repository has been downloaded and saved to using the cd change directory command.
+ Type jupyter notebook on the command line and press enter
+ After a short wait jupyter notebook will open in your web browser.
+ Open the **project.ipynb** notebook in the browser and the notebook containing the code and comments that I wrote for this assignment will be displayed.
+ If you want to run the code in any cell hold down the shift key and press enter and the command will run and the output wil be displayed in the next cell.
+ To change between edit and read mode at any time press the ESC key.
+ If you wish t run the entire notebook click Kernel in the toolbar at the top of the screen and then click Restart and run all. The notebook will refresh and all code cells will be executed from top to bottom.
+ When you have finished viewing the jupyter notebook close the web browser and return to the command line. Press Ctrl + C on the command line to kill the program.
